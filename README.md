# QR Codes - School Project
***
###
A simple project based around qr code generation, and decoding from camera or qr code image. A quick Response generator: QR-Code.

A projetct construct with a group in NSI. The first step is to easly create a QR-Code of version 1 (21x21) from an hyperlien (with a short length) and to export it in a .png picture.
Some useful basic functions have already been created, but abandoned in favor of using a third-party library to create the qr code.

This script also provide some tools to read a QR-Code from a given picture,
and decode encoded data from the camera or a specific picture

See the Jupiter Notebook for see some examples [here](qr_code_example.ipynb).

You can also view the logbook and specifications [here](journal_de_bord.ipynb).

To use kandinsky, take a look at the commands on the visual github repository [here](https://github.com/Archange-py/Visuel).
- Here's an example:
